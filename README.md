How to run the project:

1. Download the repository.

2. Run 'OSCServer_Processing.pde' in Processing

3. Run 'PYTHONCLIENT.py' in Python (I have used IDLE 3.8)

4. Start speaking to the Python program and wait to see the values within the Processing console changing + the colours of the background.
